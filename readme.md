<h1 align="center">Hangapp</h1>

<p align="center">A Front End JavaScript app | React</p>

## Description

This app app uses React to create a client for playing hangman games. It fetches data from multiple APIs to build a database of dictionary words and categories. The player can configure their gameplay, activate/deactivate categories, and view their past games. This app is front end only, and relies on localStorage to persist data between sessions.
